                    <p>The TV animation "Chiikawa" is adapted from the comic of the same name by Nagu'an and will be broadcast on Fuji TV every Friday at 6:40 on April 4, 2022. Chiikawa means something that feels small and cute.</p>
                    <p>A relaxed and pleasant, occasionally sad story brought by something very small and cute, commonly known as "little cuties".</p>
                    <p>Although I sometimes cry because of the hardship of life, the "little cute" is always surrounded by gentle friends and characters with rich personalities...</p>
                    <P>Basically, the series is a story about the daily life of the protagonist and his friends, Bamao and Rabbit, in a one-shot format.</P>
                    <P>However, the main characters are set to have a realistic background of "earning income from work and living a life".</P>
                    <P>In the serialized story, they have appeared to take the exam together, but only one person passed ("Weeding Examination"), or used a staff that could produce the required items, but turned into a monster ("Steam"), or used a hammer to break the brainwashed and petrified similar ("Secret") and so on.</P>
                    <P>The content is more ridiculous and serious.</P>

In the early days, it liked to bully Chiikawa, but as it spent a long time with Chiikawa and Hachiware, it began to value my friends, and it would also help its little cutie when she was in a crisis.</p>
                            <p>Although he is usually crazy and has a strong ability and alertness, he is the first to notice from a distance that they are chased by a big duck and go to rescue them. When Giyakawa is kidnapped by monsters, the rabbit awakened by Xiaoba immediately remains alert and is ready for battle. Have a Level 3 certificate for weeding verification. Even in the face of danger, I always maintain the same expression.</p>

Although it is not officially confirmed, the story implies that he was originally a monster named "Daqiang" who seized physical dominance from the real Xiaotao for unknown reasons. Later I learned that there was a game center that had a slot machine that could exchange souls and smashed it just in case.</p>

                            <p>As a youth comic, "Chiikawa" seems to be a fairy tale narrative with adult stories in the real world. There are problems such as labor distribution and the gap between the rich and the poor in the world. The characters need to rely on working to complete tasks such as collection, weeding, and siege to obtain living materials. They also have to face the setbacks of failure in tasks and failure in exams.</p>
                            <p>Among them, the character Xiao Ba still lives in a dilapidated cave. If the world setting full of hardships and challenges resonates with the audience, then the sincere friendship of the protagonist group makes the audience's heart full of beauty - there is still a utopian pure emotion in the dystopian world. </p>
                            <p>The timid and crying Jiyi will stand up without hesitation when his friends encounter difficulties. Xiaoba, who lives in poverty, will generously share food with his friends and care about his friends' emotions. Usachi, who is funny in daily life, will also show his strength and responsibility when he encounters difficulties. </p>
                            <p>He will establish a warm and simple friendship between the characters and gain precious emotions. Despite the difficult conditions, the characters help and encourage each other, get up and fight again when they are knocked down, and keep optimistic at any time. This state also infects the audience in front of the screen and soothes the tired and anxious hearts in real life.</p>
